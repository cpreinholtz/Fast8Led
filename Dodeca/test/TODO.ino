 * Pull in plasm from octo
 * 

 * 
 * twirl array are broken
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * create color selections for random selections
 * use pallet and pull in led values
 * 
 * 
 * Cylon duplicate to more pannels over time?  would be a vcool buildup
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Fire, 
 * 
 * nose variations
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Strobe colors with a slow fade!!
 * 
 *

 * add interpolate, to from ising pix obj
 * 
 * 
 * Add a transtiions tab with a function to select 1 randomly
 * 
 * 
 * Add a fireworks function that is independant of pixArray to layer it niceley
 * 
 * 
 * add a tempSparkle  in pix obj and other temp stuf that just gets applied to LED but not the pix obj
 * 
 * 
 * Pulse is still broken,  should  be an O.O. solution I think
 * 
 * 
 * incooperate qadd8(a,b);  investigate qsub
 * 
 * 
 * speed up blue begginigng and end
